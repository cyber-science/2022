<h3>Accomodation</h3>
<hr/>

Since the conference <a href="http://cyber-science.org/2022/venue/"><u><b>venue</b></u></a> is far from the city center, we contracted with the Eurolido Hotel a lodging package at a very convenient rate. 
We strongly suggest to exploit such offer as public transportation is not efficient and it is advisable to lodge in the conference hotel.<br/>

Shuttle transfer:<br/>
Lamezia Terme Airport (or Lamezia Terme train station) to Eurodido Hotel (and viceversa):<br/> 
- 30&euro; one way fixed rate from 1 to 3 passengers.<br/>

- Single Room - Full Board: 390&euro; per person<br/>
- Double Room - Full Board: 290&euro; per person<br/>

The CPDC2022 package includes:<br/>
- Meals: breakfast, lunch and dinner (except for Gala Dinner, which is covered by the conference registration fee).<br/>
- Facilities: in room air conditioning, access to beach services, 5 on 5 soccer pitch, tennis court, free WiFi in the hotel common areas, swimming pool.<br/>
Note: Conference registration fee includes coffee breaks and gala dinner; other meals are not included.<br/>
