<h3>Accomodation</h3>
<hr/>

Since the conference <a href="http://cyber-science.org/2022/venue/"><u><b>venue</b></u></a> is far from the city center, we contracted with the Eurolido Hotel a lodging package at a very convenient rate. 
We strongly suggest to exploit such offer as public transportation is not efficient and it is advisable to lodge in the conference hotel.<br/>

- Single Room - Full Board: 390&euro; per person<br/>
- Double Room - Full Board: 290&euro; per person<br/>
- Gala Dinner: 60&euro; per person<br/>

The package can be upgraded additional days for 110&euro;/day in single room or 85&euro;/day per person in double room.<br/>

The package includes:<br/>
Meals: breakfast, lunch and dinner*<br/>
Facilities: in room air conditioning, access to beach services, 5 on 5 soccer pitch, tennis court, free WiFi in the hotel common areas, swimming pool, babysitting (on request).<br/>
