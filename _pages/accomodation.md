<h3>Accomodation</h3>
<hr/>

Since the conference <a href="http://cyber-science.org/2022/venue/">venue</a> is far from the city center, we contracted with the Eurolido Hotel a lodging package at a very convenient rate. 
We strongly suggest to exploit such offer as public transportation is not efficient and it is advisable to lodge in the conference hotel.<br/>

- Single Room - Full Board: €390 per person<br/>
- Double Room - Full Board: €290 per person<br/>
- Gala Dinner: €60 per person<br/>

The package can be upgraded additional days for 110€/day in single room or 85€/day per person in double room.<br/>

The package includes:<br/>
Meals: breakfast, lunch and dinner*<br/>
Facilities: in room air conditioning, access to beach services, 5 on 5 soccer pitch, tennis court, free WiFi in the hotel common areas, swimming pool, babysitting (on request).<br/>
Note: Coffee breaks are included in the conference registration fee. Meals are not included in the conference registration fee.<br/>
