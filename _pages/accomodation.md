<h3>Accomodation</h3>
<hr/>

Since the conference <a href="http://cyber-science.org/2022/venue/"><u><b>venue</b></u></a> is far from the city center, we contracted with the Eurolido Hotel a lodging package at a very convenient rate. 
We strongly suggest to exploit such offer as public transportation is not efficient and it is advisable to lodge in the conference hotel.<br/>

<b>Shuttle transfer</b>:<br/>
Lamezia Terme Airport (or Lamezia Terme Train Station) to Eurolido Hotel (and viceversa):<br/> 
- 30&euro; one way fixed rate from 1 to 3 passengers.<br/> 
- 40&euro; one way fixed rate for 4 passengers.<br/>
<i>Note</i>: If there will be other participants arriving at the same time, the shuttle service will arrange only one transfer to permit the sharing of the cost among the participants.<br/>  

<b>IEEE CPDC2022 Package</b>: Check-in September 11th - Check-out September 15th:<br/>
- Single Room - Full Board: 390&euro; per person<br/>
- Double Room - Full Board: 290&euro; per person<br/>
