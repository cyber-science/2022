<p> <b>========INTRODUCTION=============</b></p>

Over the last fifty years, computational intelligence has evolved
from logic-based artificial intelligence, nature-inspired soft
computing, and social-oriented agent technology to cyber-physical
integrated ubiquitous intelligence towards Pervasive Intelligence
(PI). The International Conference on Pervasive Intelligence and
Computing is intended to cover all kinds of these intelligent
paradigms as well as their applications in various pervasive computing
domains. PICom-2019 is the conference on Pervasive Intelligence and
Computing, previously held as PCC (Las Vegas, USA, 2003 and 2004), PSC
(Las Vegas, USA, 2005), PCAC (Vienna, Austria, 2006, and Niagara
Falls, Canada, 2007), IPC-2007 (Jeju, Korea, December 2007), IPC-2008
(Sydney, Australia, December 2008), and since 2009 as the name PICom.
IEEE PICom 2021 will be held on 20-23 August 2021 in Calgary, Canada,
co-located with IEEE DASC 2021, CBDCom 2021 and IEEE CyberSciTech 2021. 
It aims to bring together computer scientists and engineers, to
discuss and exchange experimental and theoretical results,
work-in-progress, novel designs, and test-environments or test-beds in
the important areas of Pervasive Intelligence and Computing.
