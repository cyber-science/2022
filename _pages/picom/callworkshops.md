<h3>Call For Workshops and Special Sessions - IEEE PICOM 2022</h3>
<hr/>

IEEE PICOM 2022 invites one-day or half day Workshops and Special Sessions (SS) to enrich and broaden the research focus of the main conference. 
More specifically, workshops and/or special session proposals on challenging
and emerging areas related to the conference topics are especially sought. The purpose is to provide opportunities for
focused discussions on selected topics that will not be fully explored during the main event, as well as to encourage
in-depth discussion of technical and application issues related to Pervasive Intelligence and Computing. Workshops
and Special Sessions are a great addition to the main conference.
<br/>

This year we particularly solicit proposals to enable a high degree of interactions and dialogue during these
events to foster new ideas on emerging research areas, in open ended problems and potential solutions and gather
feedback. Hence, apart from the traditional full length papers, demo-related or short position papers and extended
abstracts (in the format of 2-4 double-column pages) are encouraged especially from the industry.

The proposal should contain the following information:<br/>
- The title of the Workshop/SS, including both full name and acronym 
- A brief technical description of the Workshop/SS, identification of specific technical issues, focus, and justification of how timely the workshop is 
- A brief description of the review process (including the expected number of accepted papers)
- One-page CFP of the Workshop/SS, including the submission deadline and notification date (according to the dates established for the main conference)
- Brief plans for dissemination (e.g., how to advertise the Workshop/SS or possible submissions to special issues of journals), and the expected number of participants
- History of the workshop (if any)
- Names and contact information of the organizers
- A tentative website/URL of the proposed Workshop/SS (optional)

Acceptance will be based on an evaluation of the Workshop/SS topic, its relevance to the main conference, the expected audience, and the proposer's ability to lead a successful workshop. 
<br/>

The organizers and chairs of each accepted Workshop/SS shall have full control on the call for papers, composing the program committee, managing the review and selection of papers as well as planning the workshop program. 
The review and selection of workshop papers should follow similar approaches used in the main conference. The conference organizers and not the workshop organizers will determine the registration fees for workshops. 
The fees will be paid to the conference, and the conference will provide workshop facilities including the meeting room, proceedings and conference attendance delegation for the Workshop/SS day. 
<br/>

The proceedings of the IEEE PICOM 2022 workshops will be published by Conference Publishing Services and included in the proceedings of IEEE PICOM 2022. 
<br/>

<b>Submissions</b><br/>
A single pdf file with all the material described above should be prepared. Please email your proposals in PDF format as early as possible and not later than March 15, 2022, to the Workshop Chairs. 
Please use 'PICOM 2022 Workshop-SS Proposal' as the email subject. Accepted proposals should follow strictly the important dates, particularly paper notification and camera-ready dates listed below.
