<h4>Workshop Papers</h4>
<p>Proposals for organizing tutorials, workshops and special sessions need to be submitted to the Tutorials, Workshops and Special Sessions Chairs, respectively. A proposal should include title, theme, scope and main presenters/organizers. See CFPs for Tutorial, and Workshops & SS. 
</p><h4>Research Papers</h4>
<p>Research paper (6-8 pages) should explore novel models, theory, or a specific technology problem and propose a complete solution to it, with experimental results.
</p><h4>Work-in-Progress Papers</h4>
<p>Works-in-Progress (WIP) (4-6 pages) papers are expected to present either work currently in progress or less developed but highly innovative ideas.
</p><h4>Demo/Poster Papers</h4>
<p>Demo/Poster papers (2-4 pages) must describe working systems and be related to CBDCom. These systems may be innovative prototype implementations or mature systems that use related technology.
