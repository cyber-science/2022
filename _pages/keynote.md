<b>Abstract:</b>Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an emerging architecture that supports computing, storage, and networking 
resources to users’ mobile devices (MDs). MDs have limited resources and energy capacity, and they have to offload 
some tasks of computational/delay-intensive applications to their nearby small base station (SBS), which is a paradigm 
of MEC. Although task offloading decreases energy consumed by MDs, it brings additional transmission delay among MDs 
and SBS/cloud data center (CDC), and processing delay in SBS and CDC. This talk considers two challenging research 
problems in MEC. First, this talk introduces a constrained optimization problem to minimize the total cost of a 
heterogeneous system including MDs, an SBS, and a CDC while strictly guaranteeing delay limits of tasks. 
Second, this talk further considers a more complicated scenario including both macro base stations (MBSs) and small 
base stations (SBSs) where resource-limited MDs are associated with them. This talk then introduces a partial 
computation offloading approach for delay-sensitive applications in such a hybrid network including MDs, SBSs, and an MBS. 
The total energy consumption minimization is formulated as a constrained mixed-integer nonlinear program. 
It jointly optimizes task offloading among MDs, SBSs, and MBS, users’ connection to SBSs, MDs CPU speeds and 
transmission power, and channels bandwidth allocation. To solve the above two problems, a hybrid method named 
Genetic Simulated-annealing-based Particle swarm optimization (GSP) is proposed and it integrates genetic 
operations of genetic algorithm and the Metropolis acceptance rule of simulated annealing into particle swarm 
optimization. Simulations with real-world data demonstrate that GSP significantly outperforms other methods 
in the energy consumption of the system.
