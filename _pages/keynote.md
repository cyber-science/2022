<b>Abstract: </b>Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an emerging architecture that supports computing, storage, and networking 
resources to users’ mobile devices (MDs). MDs have limited resources and energy capacity, and they have to offload 
some tasks of computational/delay-intensive applications to their nearby small base station (SBS), which is a paradigm 
of MEC. Although task offloading decreases energy consumed by MDs, it brings additional transmission delay among MDs 
and SBS/cloud data center (CDC), and processing delay in SBS and CDC. This talk considers two challenging research 
problems in MEC. First, this talk introduces a constrained optimization problem to minimize the total cost of a 
heterogeneous system including MDs, an SBS, and a CDC while strictly guaranteeing delay limits of tasks. 
Second, this talk further considers a more complicated scenario including both macro base stations (MBSs) and small 
base stations (SBSs) where resource-limited MDs are associated with them. This talk then introduces a partial 
computation offloading approach for delay-sensitive applications in such a hybrid network including MDs, SBSs, and an MBS. 
The total energy consumption minimization is formulated as a constrained mixed-integer nonlinear program. 
It jointly optimizes task offloading among MDs, SBSs, and MBS, users’ connection to SBSs, MDs CPU speeds and 
transmission power, and channels bandwidth allocation. To solve the above two problems, a hybrid method named 
Genetic Simulated-annealing-based Particle swarm optimization (GSP) is proposed and it integrates genetic 
operations of genetic algorithm and the Metropolis acceptance rule of simulated annealing into particle swarm 
optimization. Simulations with real-world data demonstrate that GSP significantly outperforms other methods 
in the energy consumption of the system.

<h4>Side and Covert Channels: the Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde of Modern Technologies</h4>

<br/>
University of Padua, Italy
<p>
<b>Abstract: </b>While Smartphone and IoT devices usage become more and more pervasive,
people start also asking to which extent such devices can be maliciously
exploited as “tracking devices”. The concern is not only related to an
adversary taking physical or remote control of the device, but also to
what a passive adversary without the above capabilities can observe from
the device communications. Work in this latter direction aimed, for
example, at inferring the apps a user has installed on his device, or
identifying the presence of a specific user within a network. In this
talk, we discuss threats coming from contextual information and to which
extent it is feasible, for example, to identify the specific actions
that a user is doing on mobile apps, by eavesdropping their encrypted
network traffic. We will also discuss the possibility of building covert
and side channels leveraging timing, heat, energy consumption, and audio
signals, to steal information from mobile devices, as well as inferring
keypresses, password & PINs.

<h4>The path from rigid to soft robotics: Symbiotic Control of Wearable Soft Suits for human Augmentation and Assistance</h4>

<p>
<b>Abstract: </b>Soft wearable exosuits have been introduced in the last decade as possible candidates to overcome 
the limitations from devices using rigid structures: the exoskeletons.
Despite the Exosuits initially promised tangible improvements, yet their soft wearable architecture presents 
strong drawbacks, placing this technology more in a complementary position rather than on a higher step of 
the podium respect to their predecessors. 
Motivations can be found in their soft structure which not only undershoots in terms of assistance delivery 
respect to the exoskeletons, but also introduces non-linear dynamic behaviours making difficult the formalization 
of a robust control implementation and substantially hampering the matching with the wearer´s biomechanics.
During my speech I will introduce the progress from our research on soft wearable exosuits, by presenting 
novel solutions on mechanical design, novel implementation of control strategies based n machine learning to 
master the non-linear behaviours.  I will discuss in details how using biosignals by means of a realtime 
techniques based on musculoskeletal dynamics to provide a symbiotic interface between the exosuit and the 
user and compared such a solution with a classical control approaches.

<h4>Explainable Pervasive Intelligence with Self-explaining Agents</h4>

<p>
<b>Abstract: </b>Pervasiveness of ICT resources along with the promise of ubiquitous intelligence is pushing hard both our demand and our fears of 
AI: demand mandates for the ability to inject intelligence ubiquitously; fears compel the behaviour of intelligent systems to be observable, explainable, 
and accountable.  Whereas the first wave of the new "AI Era" was mostly heralded by sub-symbolic approaches, features like explainability are better provided 
by symbolic techniques.  In particular, the notion of explanation should be regarded as a core notion for intelligent systems, rather than just an add-on to 
make them understandable to humans. Based on symbolic AI techniques to match intuitive and rational cognition, explanation should then be regarded as a fundamental 
tool for inter-agent communication among heterogeneous intelligent agents in open multi-agent systems. More generally, self-explaining agents should work as the 
basic components in the engineering of intelligent systems integrating both symbolic and sub-/non-symbolic AI techniques.

<h4>Neoteric Frontiers in Cloud and Edge Computing</h4>

<br/>

<p>
<b>Abstract: </b>Computing is being transformed to a model consisting of services that are delivered in a manner
similar to utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and telephony. In such a model, users access
services based on their requirements without regard to where the services are hosted or how they
are delivered. Cloud computing paradigm has turned this vision of "computing utilities" into a
reality. It offers infrastructure, platform, and software as services, which are made available to
consumers as subscription-oriented services. Cloud application platforms need to offer (1) APIs
and tools for rapid creation of elastic applications and (2) a runtime system for deployment of
applications on geographically distributed computing infrastructure in a seamless manner.
The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm enables seamless integration of cyber-and-physical
worlds and opening up opportunities for creating new class of applications for domains such as
smart cities and smart healthcare. The emerging Fog/Edge computing paradigm is extends Cloud
computing model to edge resources for latency sensitive IoT applications with a seamless
integration of network-wide resources all the way from edge to the Cloud.
This keynote presentation will cover (a) 21st century vision of computing and identifies various
IT paradigms promising to deliver the vision of computing utilities; (b) innovative architecture
for creating elastic Clouds integrating edge resources and managed Clouds, (c) Aneka 5G, a
Cloud Application Platform, for rapid development of Cloud/Big Data applications and their
deployment on private/public Clouds with resource provisioning driven by SLAs, (d) a novel
FogBus software framework with Blockchain-based data-integrity management for facilitating
end-to-end IoT-Fog/Edge-Cloud integration for execution of sensitive IoT applications, (e)
experimental results on deploying Cloud and Big Data/ IoT applications in engineering, and
health care (e.g., COVID-19), deep learning/Artificial intelligence (AI), satellite image
processing, natural language processing (mining COVID-19 research literature for new insights)
and smart cities on elastic Clouds; and (f) directions for delivering our 21st century vision along
with pathways for future research in Cloud and Edge/Fog computing.

<b>Abstract: </b>Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are digital assets that represent objects like art, collectible, and in-game items. They are traded online, often with cryptocurrency, and are generally encoded within smart contracts on a blockchain. In the Metaverse it is possible to collect avatars and game items, wear digital designer clothes and exhibit intangible works of art, all easily purchased in the form of NFTs. 
We looked at 6.1 million trades of 4.7 million NFTs to learn about market traders, visual features and price prediction. During this talk, we will try to understand self-organizing communities in web3 networks, especially art-related communities. Is the decentralised NFT world really decentralised? Or is it re-creating the same structures we know in the traditional art market?
