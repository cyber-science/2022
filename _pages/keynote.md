<b>Abstract:</b>Mobile edge computing (MEC) is an emerging architecture that supports computing, storage, and networking 
resources to users’ mobile devices (MDs). MDs have limited resources and energy capacity, and they have to offload 
some tasks of computational/delay-intensive applications to their nearby small base station (SBS), which is a paradigm 
of MEC. Although task offloading decreases energy consumed by MDs, it brings additional transmission delay among MDs 
and SBS/cloud data center (CDC), and processing delay in SBS and CDC. This talk considers two challenging research 
problems in MEC. First, this talk introduces a constrained optimization problem to minimize the total cost of a 
heterogeneous system including MDs, an SBS, and a CDC while strictly guaranteeing delay limits of tasks. 
Second, this talk further considers a more complicated scenario including both macro base stations (MBSs) and small 
base stations (SBSs) where resource-limited MDs are associated with them. This talk then introduces a partial 
computation offloading approach for delay-sensitive applications in such a hybrid network including MDs, SBSs, and an MBS. 
The total energy consumption minimization is formulated as a constrained mixed-integer nonlinear program. 
It jointly optimizes task offloading among MDs, SBSs, and MBS, users’ connection to SBSs, MDs CPU speeds and 
transmission power, and channels bandwidth allocation. To solve the above two problems, a hybrid method named 
Genetic Simulated-annealing-based Particle swarm optimization (GSP) is proposed and it integrates genetic 
operations of genetic algorithm and the Metropolis acceptance rule of simulated annealing into particle swarm 
optimization. Simulations with real-world data demonstrate that GSP significantly outperforms other methods 
in the energy consumption of the system.

<h4>Side and Covert Channels: the Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde of Modern Technologies</h4>

<b>Abstract:</b>While Smartphone and IoT devices usage become more and more pervasive,
people start also asking to which extent such devices can be maliciously
exploited as “tracking devices”. The concern is not only related to an
adversary taking physical or remote control of the device, but also to
what a passive adversary without the above capabilities can observe from
the device communications. Work in this latter direction aimed, for
example, at inferring the apps a user has installed on his device, or
identifying the presence of a specific user within a network. In this
talk, we discuss threats coming from contextual information and to which
extent it is feasible, for example, to identify the specific actions
that a user is doing on mobile apps, by eavesdropping their encrypted
network traffic. We will also discuss the possibility of building covert
and side channels leveraging timing, heat, energy consumption, and audio
signals, to steal information from mobile devices, as well as inferring
keypresses, password & PINs.

<h4>The path from rigid to soft robotics: Symbiotic Control of Wearable Soft Suits for human Augmentation and Assistance</h4>

<b>Abstract:</b>Soft wearable exosuits have been introduced in the last decade as possible candidates to overcome 
the limitations from devices using rigid structures: the exoskeletons.
Despite the Exosuits initially promised tangible improvements, yet their soft wearable architecture presents 
strong drawbacks, placing this technology more in a complementary position rather than on a higher step of 
the podium respect to their predecessors. 
Motivations can be found in their soft structure which not only undershoots in terms of assistance delivery 
respect to the exoskeletons, but also introduces non-linear dynamic behaviours making difficult the formalization 
of a robust control implementation and substantially hampering the matching with the wearer´s biomechanics.
During my speech I will introduce the progress from our research on soft wearable exosuits, by presenting 
novel solutions on mechanical design, novel implementation of control strategies based n machine learning to 
master the non-linear behaviours.  I will discuss in details how using biosignals by means of a realtime 
techniques based on musculoskeletal dynamics to provide a symbiotic interface between the exosuit and the 
user and compared such a solution with a classical control approaches.
