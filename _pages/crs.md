Detailed instructions can be found <a href="https://www.ieee.org/publications/rights/index.html"><u>here</u></a>.</li>
<li>Proofread and check the layout of the manuscript (it is highly recommended that you do this BEFORE going to IEEE PDF eXpress).</li>
<li>Create an IEEE PDF eXpress account at <a href="https://ieee-pdf-express.org/"><u>IEEE PDF Express</u></a> (conference ID <b>55231X</b>).</li>
<li>Upload source file(s) for Conversion; and/or PDF(s) for Checking.</li>
<li>Use IEEE PDF eXpress to attain IEEE Xplore-compatible PDF(s). The site contains extensive instructions, resources, helpful hints, and access to technical support.</li>
<li>If the IEEE PDF eXpress check has no problem, you will receive your final PDF eXpress checked paper by email (and you will be able to download it at <a href="https://ieee-pdf-express.org/"><u>IEEE PDF Express</u></a>).</li>
<li>Create a zip file containing:<br/>
