 <b>Panel Abstract: </b>
<br/>Human cognition is a complex neural process ranging from sensory-motor tasks to decision making. Hyper intelligence strives to accomplish complex tasks through creation or combination of diverse intelligent systems used by humans or machines based on a variety of methodologies, algorithms, and models in statistics, computation, and mathematics. Current panel HCHI will focus on various aspects of human cognition and hyper intelligence, as well as their relations and interactions. The five key panelists are active researchers and professionals who offer their perspectives on: cognitive process (Shimojo), functions of consciousness (Kanai), model fusion (Schweikert), supply chain development (David), and convergence of technologies (Piuri).
