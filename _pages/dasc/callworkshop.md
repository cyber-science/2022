<h3>Call For Workshop Proposals - IEEE DASC 2021</h3>
<hr/>

<p>
DASC 2021 invites Workshops and Special Sessions (SS) to enrich and broaden the research focus of the main conference. The purpose is to provide a comprehensive forum on topics that will not be fully explored during the main event as well as to encourage in-depth discussion of technical and application issues related to dependability, security, and automaticity. This is a unique opportunity for researchers and industry practitioners to shape the future research directions and share their original research results and practical development experiences on specific topics related to dependability, security, and automaticity.
</p><p>
The workshop proposal, in PDF or MS Word, should provide the following information, in the following format:
</p>
<ul><li>
 The title of the Workshop/SS, including both full name and abbreviation.
</li><li> The objectives, scope and contributions to the main conference (up to 1 page).
</li><li> The short bios of the key organizers and their experience in conference/workshop organization.
</li><li> Brief plans for dissemination (e.g., how to advertise the Workshop/SS or possible submissions to special issues of journals), procedures for selecting papers (including the expected number of accepted papers), and the expected number of participants.
</li><li> A tentative list of program committee members.
</li><li> A tentative website/URL of the proposed Workshop/SS.
</li><li>If the proposed Workshop/SS has been previously organized, please also briefly describe its history (e.g., number of submissions and accepted papers, attendance, etc.)
</li></ul>

<p>
Please email your intellectually stimulating proposals in PDF format as early as possible and not later than Feb 28, 2021 to the Workshop Chairs at "Mostafa Fouda" 
<a href="mailto:mfouda@ieee.org"> mailto:mfouda@ieee.org</a>

For accepted proposals, organizers are responsible for composing the corresponding Workshop/SS program committees, advertising call for papers, reviewing submissions and planning the final program.

The Congress will provide facilities including the working notes printing, meeting rooms, coffee breaks, lunches, proceedings, etc.
</p><p>
A Workshop/SS paper should be 5-6 pages, following the same Paper Submission Guidelines as the main conference papers. Each paper should be reviewed at least by two reviewers in the corresponding areas. All accepted Workshop/SS papers will be included in the proceedings published by IEEE-CS Conference Publishing Services in IEEE-DL and EI index.

The accepted papers in a cancelled Workshop/SS may be moved to another Workshop/SS, or to the main conference track if they fit in with the quality requirement. The registration requirement and procedure for Workshop/SS papers will be determined by DASC 2021 Organizing Committee, and the registration fee will be paid directly to DASC 2021. The registration fee can be waived for a Workshop/SS’s main organizer if there are more than 10 accepted papers.
